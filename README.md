# Refactoring-Tic-Tac-Toe
Title: Refactoring Tic Tac Toe

Description: This project creates a tic-tac-toe board game to play. The files in this project contain code provided by the Full Stack Development with MERN course with edits by me.

How to run: Download all files. Node.js is required. Use powershell and navigate to the folder with the downloads. Start a server in that folder and put its address in your browser.

Future improvements: I would like for the squares to change colors instead of just the letters. I would also like for it to keep score if the same people want to play several times in a row.
